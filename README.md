# 2022-08-19 Hello, we are My Career!
After a lot of back and forth, and many hours of development, we finally did it! A real eureka moment a week ago really ignited the fire under us and in the last week we have iterated over and over and we are finally pleased to show off what this is! My Career is a digital product that will empower users all over the world to have a digital presence in the form of their very own site. Build your CV using our simple form and then 30 seconds after clicking the button, you have your own site, as easy as that!

## So, who are we?
The team at My Career is relatively small, but don't let that put you off. We have a wealth of experience in technology, but more importantly we want to empower people with technology. We feel that the old fashioned printed CV, while still viable, will be out of fashion ion the next few years and we wanted to fill that upcoming void. 

The team here is comprised of two people currently; Sam and Simon, read on a little more to find out about us.

### Sam: Co-founder
A driven, entrepreneurial and passionate professional with a desire to deliver only high quality products and services. He has worked across multiple sectors, but has found his calling in delivering products that focus heavily around EdTech and allowing people to unlock their potential. He has 10+ years of software engineering experience and strives to find the most optimal solution to any problem.

### Simon: Co-founder
Experienced Web Developer and Team lead with a demonstrated history of working in the e-learning industry. Skilled in Web Design and Development, Product Management, Agile Methodologies, Customer and Technical Support. Strong professional with a passion for technology and problem solving.

## What have we managed so far?
Quite a lot actually! This current version of this product is very lean in what it offers. Not because we couldn't finish it, but we felt that this was the optimal time to deliver! Is it finished? Far from it! We want to build this product over a number of years and enable users all around the world. So far in this release we offer the following:

- A simple form that only supports employment history and a few basic details
- One default theme, it's nothing crazy, but it showcases what is possible
- Image uploads for your avatar
- Your own [my-career.info](https://my-career.info) sub domain e.g. [https://sam.street.my-career.info](this.my-career.info)
