# 2022-09-19 Big changes

Hey, it’s us again!

It’s been very quiet on here for the last few weeks, we’re sorry about that! We had such tremendous feedback from a number of users that we decided it was best to really focus on giving this product the love that it deserved.

But here we are! We have taken all the feedback on board, polished the whole product and learned a lot in the last month. So what have we being doing, you ask? Quite a lot is the answer.

- We revamped the entire user interface, we are now mobile compliant, but work best on a tablet and up.
- We have added custom theme colours (this one we are super proud of) so you can make your CV be an actual representation of you.
- We now have a more unique domain generation solution, the old one just wasn’t quite unique enough!
- We finished the default theme off and gave it a tidy up, but don’t worry lots more themes are on the way!
- Notifications for registered users and every time your site deploys, nothing crazy, just a little something to let you know something is happening.
- New education section.
- You can now drag and drop reorder your employment and education.
- A lot of under the hood magic, meaning we are more performant and robust.
- Changes to the way skills were represented and handled in the builder form.

Phew, that’s an awful lot of changes and improvements! But what’s next?

We still have a lot of work and a lot of feedback that we are still working through. These next few weeks we are going to add a new theme, more customisation options and even some magic around exportable/printable versions of your CV, so keep your eyes peeled!

It’s been an exciting few weeks and we are super excited about the upcoming changes and additions that we have planned and we can’t wait to show you all!


# 2022-08-19 Hello, we are My Career!
After a lot of back and forth, and many hours of development, we finally did it! A real eureka moment a week ago really ignited the fire under us and in the last week we have iterated over and over and we are finally pleased to show off what this is! My Career is a digital product that will empower users all over the world to have a digital presence in the form of their very own site. Build your CV using our simple form and then 30 seconds after clicking the button, you have your own site, as easy as that!

## So, who are we?
The team at My Career is relatively small, but don't let that put you off. We have a wealth of experience in technology, but more importantly we want to empower people with technology. We feel that the old fashioned printed CV, while still viable, will be out of fashion ion the next few years and we wanted to fill that upcoming void. 

The team here is comprised of two people currently; Sam and Simon, read on a little more to find out about us.

### Sam: Co-founder
A driven, entrepreneurial and passionate professional with a desire to deliver only high quality products and services. He has worked across multiple sectors, but has found his calling in delivering products that focus heavily around EdTech and allowing people to unlock their potential. He has 10+ years of software engineering experience and strives to find the most optimal solution to any problem.

### Simon: Co-founder
Experienced Web Developer and Team lead with a demonstrated history of working in the e-learning industry. Skilled in Web Design and Development, Product Management, Agile Methodologies, Customer and Technical Support. Strong professional with a passion for technology and problem solving.

## What have we managed so far?
Quite a lot actually! This current version of this product is very lean in what it offers. Not because we couldn't finish it, but we felt that this was the optimal time to deliver! Is it finished? Far from it! We want to build this product over a number of years and enable users all around the world. So far in this release we offer the following:

- A simple form that only supports employment history and a few basic details
- One default theme, it's nothing crazy, but it showcases what is possible
- Image uploads for your avatar
- Your own [my-career.info](https://my-career.info) sub domain e.g. [example.mycareer.info](https://sam.street.my-career.info)
